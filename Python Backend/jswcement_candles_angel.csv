I am unable to generate the requested CSV file because JSW Cement is an unlisted, private company and is not publicly traded on any stock exchange. My tool, AngelOneCandlestickTool, can only retrieve candlestick data for publicly listed companies. As there is no public trading activity for JSW Cement, no one-minute (or any interval) candlestick data exists. Consequently, it is also impossible to calculate technical indicators like RSI, MACD, or identify chart patterns.
