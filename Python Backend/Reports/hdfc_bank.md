### **2. Balance Sheet Summary**

The merger with HDFC Ltd. has significantly expanded HDFC Bank's balance sheet, creating a financial powerhouse. The key challenge is funding this larger asset base, necessitating an aggressive strategy for deposit mobilization. The liability profile remains robust, anchored by a strong, albeit temporarily diluted, retail deposit franchise.

<br>

<BALANCE SHEET>
- **Total Assets (as of Q2 FY24):** ₹34.28 Trillion
- **Total Deposits:** ₹21.73 Trillion
- **Gross Advances:** ₹23.55 Trillion
- **Net Worth:** ₹4.05 Trillion
- **CASA Ratio:** 37.6% (down from ~44% pre-merger, reflecting the integration of HDFC's wholesale borrowings)
- **Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR):** 19.5% (Tier 1 at 17.8%), well above the regulatory requirement of 11.7%.

**Liability Analysis:**
The bank's liability structure is dominated by deposits, which constitute approximately 63% of the total balance sheet. The post-merger CASA ratio has declined, indicating a higher reliance on term deposits and borrowings from the erstwhile HDFC Ltd. book. Management's primary focus is on rebuilding the CASA ratio and accelerating deposit growth to replace high-cost wholesale borrowings over the next several quarters. The strong CAR provides a substantial buffer for future growth and to absorb any unforeseen credit costs.

### **3. Technical Analysis**

The stock has been in a consolidation phase post-merger announcement and has underperformed the broader market, creating a potentially attractive entry point from a valuation perspective. It is currently trading below key long-term moving averages, indicating near-term bearish sentiment, but is showing signs of bottoming out near a strong support zone.

<br>

<TECHNICALS>
- **Trend:** The short-to-medium-term trend is sideways to bearish. The stock is trading below its 50-day (~₹1,580) and 200-day (~₹1,635) Simple Moving Averages (SMA), which are acting as overhead resistance.
- **Support:** Strong support is visible in the ₹1,480 - ₹1,500 zone, which has been tested multiple times. A decisive break below this could lead to further downside. The next major support is at ₹1,450.
- **Resistance:** Immediate resistance is at the 50-day SMA around ₹1,580. A key psychological and technical resistance level is ₹1,630 - ₹1,650, coinciding with the 200-day SMA.
- **Indicators:**
    - **RSI (14-day):** Currently at 42. The indicator is in neutral territory, moving up from oversold levels, suggesting a potential waning of bearish momentum.
    - **MACD:** The MACD line is below the signal line but is showing signs of a potential bullish crossover from below the zero line, which could signal a reversal if confirmed with price action.
- **Pattern:** The stock is forming a base in the ₹1,480-₹1,550 range. A breakout above the consolidation range and the 50-day SMA would be a positive signal for a trend reversal.

### **4. News Summary**

-   **Post-Merger Integration:** The primary focus remains on the synergies and challenges of the HDFC Ltd. merger. Q2 FY24 results, the first full quarter post-merger, revealed pressure on Net Interest Margins (NIMs), which contracted to 3.4%. This was largely anticipated due to the lower-yielding mortgage book and higher funding costs.
-   **Management Guidance:** Management has guided for a gradual improvement in margins as the bank replaces high-cost borrowings with lower-cost retail deposits. They have emphasized a "4 branches every 5 days" expansion strategy to bolster deposit collection.
-   **Asset Quality:** Asset quality remains a standout positive. Gross and Net NPA levels are among the best in the industry, even after absorbing the HDFC Ltd. portfolio. This reflects the bank's prudent underwriting standards.
-   **FII Selling:** The stock has faced persistent selling pressure from Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), partly due to MSCI index weight adjustments post-merger and concerns over near-term profitability metrics. This has contributed significantly to the stock's recent underperformance.

### **5. Final Recommendation: BUY**

**Justification:**

We issue a **BUY** recommendation on HDFC Bank with a 12-month price target of ₹1,850.

The current stock price reflects near-term headwinds related to merger integration, primarily NIM compression and the challenge of deposit growth. However, we believe these concerns are temporary and that the market is underappreciating the long-term strategic value of the merged entity.

**The investment thesis is built on:**

1.  **Valuation Comfort:** The stock is trading at a P/B of 2.9x, a significant discount to its historical average. This de-rating provides a compelling entry point for long-term investors.
2.  **Unmatched Franchise:** The merger has created a financial behemoth with an unparalleled distribution network and product suite. The ability to cross-sell mortgages to its 80+ million banking customers and banking products to mortgage customers presents a massive, long-term synergy opportunity.
3.  **Fortress Balance Sheet:** Despite margin pressures, the bank's asset quality remains pristine, and its capital adequacy (CAR at 19.5%) is exceptionally strong, providing a robust foundation for growth.
4.  **Proven Management:** HDFC Bank's management has a stellar track record of execution. We are confident in their ability to navigate the integration process and deliver on their guidance of rebuilding margins and accelerating growth over the next 18-24 months.

While technical indicators suggest short-term consolidation may continue, the stock is trading near a strong support base. We recommend accumulating the stock at current levels for long-term capital appreciation as the merger synergies begin to materialize and profitability metrics normalize.
