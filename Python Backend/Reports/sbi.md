### 2. Balance Sheet Summary

SBI's balance sheet reflects its dominant position in the Indian banking system. The bank has demonstrated strong growth in both its deposit base and loan book, underpinned by a healthy capitalization level.

<br>

<details>
<summary>BALANCE SHEET</summary>

**Key Items (as of March 31, 2024):**
*   **Total Deposits:** ₹49,66,542 Cr. (Up 11.13% YoY)
*   **Gross Advances (Loans):** ₹37,67,443 Cr. (Up 15.24% YoY)
*   **Total Assets:** ₹60,90,171 Cr.
*   **Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR):** 14.28% (Well above the regulatory requirement of 11.70%)

**Liability Analysis:**
*   The bank maintains a strong low-cost deposit franchise, with the CASA (Current Account Savings Account) ratio at a healthy 41.11%. While this has moderated slightly, it remains a key competitive advantage, keeping the cost of funds in check.
*   The overall deposit growth of over 11% YoY ensures a stable funding source for its aggressive loan expansion.
*   The Debt-to-Equity ratio for a bank is best analyzed through its Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR). At 14.28%, SBI is well-capitalized to absorb unexpected losses and support future growth without needing immediate capital infusion.

</details>

**Balance Sheet Analysis:**
The double-digit growth in both advances and deposits is a strong indicator of market leadership and economic momentum. The robust credit growth of over 15%, driven by the retail and SME segments, outpaces deposit growth, signaling strong loan demand. The bank's solid CAR provides a thick cushion, ensuring financial stability and the capacity for further expansion.

*   **Trend:** Strong Uptrend. The price is trading above its 50-day (~₹810) and 200-day (~₹685) moving averages, which is a classic sign of bullish strength.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index - 14 Day):** 64.5. The RSI is in the bullish momentum zone (above 60) but not yet in the overbought territory (>70). This indicates that there is still room for further upside before the stock becomes technically extended.
*   **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):** The MACD line is trading above the signal line, and both are above the zero line, confirming strong upward momentum and a bullish trend.
*   **Chart Patterns:** The stock has recently broken out of a consolidation phase and is in price discovery mode, trading near its all-time highs.
*   **Support Levels:**
    *   **Immediate Support:** ₹825 (Previous swing high)
    *   **Key Support:** ₹800 (Psychological level and 50-day EMA zone)
    *   **Major Support:** ₹770 (Previous breakout level)
*   **Resistance Levels:**
    *   **Immediate Resistance:** ₹859 (All-time high)
    *   **Psychological Resistance:** ₹900

</details>

**Technical Interpretation:**
The technical setup is unequivocally bullish. The combination of a strong uptrend, positive momentum indicators (RSI and MACD), and trading above key moving averages suggests that the path of least resistance is upwards. Any minor dips or pullbacks towards the support levels, particularly around the ₹800-₹825 zone, should be considered buying opportunities. A decisive break above the all-time high of ₹859 would open the door for a move towards the psychological milestone of ₹900 and beyond.
