### 1. Company Overview and Key Financial Ratios

Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) is one of India's largest conglomerates with diversified interests across Oil to Chemicals (O2C), Digital Services (Jio Platforms), Retail (Reliance Retail), and New Energy. The company is in a strategic transition, leveraging its dominant position in traditional businesses to fund high-growth, consumer-facing, and green energy ventures. This positions RIL as a proxy for India's broad economic growth, from energy consumption to digital adoption and retail spending.

### 5. Final Recommendation: BUY

**Justification:**

We recommend a **BUY** on Reliance Industries with a 12-month price target of **₹3,450**.

The investment thesis is built on three core pillars:
1.  **Unmatched Market Leadership:** RIL holds a dominant or leading position in nearly every sector it operates in—telecom, retail, and refining. This scale provides a significant competitive moat and pricing power.
2.  **Embedded Growth Engines:** The consumer-facing businesses, Jio and Retail, are high-growth engines with massive runways for expansion, driven by India's demographic and digital trends. The potential future IPOs of these entities serve as a key value-unlocking catalyst for shareholders.
3.  **Future-Proofing through New Energy:** The strategic and large-scale pivot to Green Energy positions RIL to be a leader in India's energy transition. This not only creates a new, sustainable growth vertical but also enhances the company's ESG profile.

From a technical standpoint, the stock is well-positioned for a breakout. Fundamentally, while the valuation is not cheap, it is justified by the superior growth outlook and the strength of its balance sheet. We advise accumulating the stock on any dips towards the strong support zone of **₹2,880 - ₹2,900**.
