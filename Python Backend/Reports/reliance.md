## 5. Final Recommendation: HOLD

**Justification:**

Reliance is a fundamentally strong company with a diversified business portfolio. The company's strong financial performance, coupled with its investments in growth sectors like retail and telecommunications, makes it an attractive long-term investment.

However, the current RSI approaching overbought levels and potential resistance at ₹2600 suggest limited near-term upside. The regulatory uncertainty surrounding the petrochemicals acquisition also warrants caution.

Therefore, a **HOLD** recommendation is appropriate at the current level. Investors should monitor the stock for a potential breakout above resistance or a pullback to support levels before making further investment decisions. Further, monitor news regarding the regulatory approvals.
