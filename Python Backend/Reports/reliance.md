RIL is also making significant investments in its New Energy business, aiming to become a global leader in green energy solutions. The company's strategy focuses on leveraging technology and consumer-facing businesses to drive future growth, while gradually transitioning towards a more sustainable energy portfolio.

### **2. Balance Sheet Summary**

RIL has successfully executed a significant deleveraging strategy over the past few years, primarily through strategic stake sales in its digital and retail arms and strong internal cash flow generation. The balance sheet remains robust and well-capitalized to fund its ambitious expansion plans, particularly in the New Energy vertical.

</details>

**Liability Analysis:**

*   A significant portion of the debt is long-term, providing financial flexibility for short-term operations.
*   While the Current Ratio is slightly below 1, the company's massive operating cash flows (over ₹1.4 Lakh Cr. in FY24) mitigate any liquidity concerns. The balance sheet is well-positioned to support the next phase of capital-intensive growth in 5G and New Energy.

### **5. Final Recommendation: BUY**

**Justification:**

We issue a **BUY** recommendation for Reliance Industries with a 12-month price target of **₹3,450**. This is based on a sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation that reflects the sustained growth momentum in its consumer businesses and assigns a preliminary valuation to the nascent New Energy vertical.

*   **Strong Growth Drivers:** The twin engines of Jio and Retail continue to fire on all cylinders, capturing market share and delivering consistent double-digit growth. This provides a stable foundation for earnings.
*   **Deleveraged Balance Sheet:** RIL's balance sheet is the strongest it has been in years, providing ample firepower to fund future growth without stressing its financial position.
*   **Future-Proofing the Business:** The strategic and aggressive pivot to New Energy is a significant long-term catalyst that positions RIL to be a leader in the global energy transition. This provides a multi-decade growth runway.
*   **Constructive Technicals:** The stock's bullish trend, supported by key technical indicators, suggests positive market sentiment and a high probability of continued upward movement.

While the O2C business faces cyclical headwinds and the stock's valuation is not inexpensive, the long-term growth trajectory driven by consumer platforms and the new energy super-cycle provides a compelling investment case.
